-HardInk version 1.414-

-Release Notes-
Pen and paper. And tags.
If you mess up, cross it out with two lines.
If you don’t like it, throw it away.
What you throw away does not come back.
There is no Undo.
Kindness is kept to a minimum.
Use a two-finger swipe.
That will tell you almost everything.
You ever learn how to use a pen and paper from someone?
When you archive, everything disappears from the app.
What matters stays as a ZIP file in Files or the place you choose.
Free. No ads. No in-app purchases.
That is exactly why it can stay pure.
— The Designer
P.S. A Paid version exists.

-Accessibility-
HardInk can be used without sound.
If you prefer vibration feedback, tap 🔍 and enable VIB.
